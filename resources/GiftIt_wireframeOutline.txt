Project Description: The top level goal is to make an app that lets users save and organize gift ideas for their friends. I want to include a home page where users can save gift idea cards for friends/family by name and have conversations with anyone that's visited their profile. I also want the user to be able to edit/add information to their own profile and search for the profiles of other users. Once on another user's page the signed in user can leave and like comments and view any details they've added to their profile for additional context on what kinds of gifts they might enjoy!

New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: 
- User authentication in MERN
- Relational Collections in Mongoose/MongoDB (User, cards, comments, likes)
- Socket.io - so that all users can see others reactions and comments in real time
